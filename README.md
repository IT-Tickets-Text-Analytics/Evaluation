# Evaluation
The development of handcrafted rules and thresholds and quantitative evaluation are implemented iteratively using Microsoft Office Excel 2016. In this repository, we present the documents: (i) an evaluation questionnaire used with process workers and (ii) a detailed description of the iterative evaluation of the approach and rule establishment process.
